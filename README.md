# About
Hextris was created by a couple high school friends (who are now in college!) who unfortunately don't have as much time to update the game. If you'd like to support the open-source development of Hextris, please consider donating at:

**ETH:** `0xbf5414129552D37B4Fb12D058Cf1596B960d25b2`

The code was forked and updated to a Progressive Web App by Chris Love. The purpose to show how easy it is to make a progressive web app and of course to have some fun!
